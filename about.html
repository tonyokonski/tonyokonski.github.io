	<h1>About me; basically. (tl:dr version)</h1>

	<p>
		I became interested in web development about 4 years ago while I was working as a communications coordinator in a computer science department at a university. Although my job was focused on marketing, it enabled me to play with snippets of html, css, and JavaScript. I was amazed at what I could create with those tools. I worked alongside computer scientists and their students and was able to learn about the basics of web development and programming. I found that I was thoroughly enjoying working with the web, and decided to make a career out of it. So here I am.
