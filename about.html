				<h1>About me; basically.</h1>

				<p>
					I became interested in web development about 4 years ago while I was working as a communications coordinator in a computer science department at a well-known university. My job enabled me to play with snippets of html, css, and JavaScript. I was amazed at what I could create with those tools. I was also surrounded by computer scientists and their students, and was able to learn about the basics of web development and programming. Now I want to take the next step and be a part of a team that builds fantastic websites. For a more detailed story of my journey, visit <a href="#">my in-depth bio page</a>.
