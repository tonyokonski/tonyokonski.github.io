				<h1>Welcome!</h1>

				<p>
					Thanks for stopping by my little slice of the web. This portfolio site is a work in progress. Feel free to cruise around and learn more about my journey as a web developer. Although this journey is in its early stage, check back often as this will be the platform for my many ideas for web projects. Cheers!

				<h1>Why you should hire me.</h1>

				<p>

				<h1>About me; basically.</h1>

				<p>
					I became interested in web development about 4 years ago while I was working as a communications coordinator in a computer science department at a well-known university. My job enabled me to play with snippets of html and css, and I was amazed at what I could create with them. I was surrounded by computer scientists and their students, and was able to learn from many of them about the basics of web development and programming in general. For a more detailed story of my journey, visit <a href="#">my in-depth bio page</a>.

				<h1>Obligatory animated skill set graph</h1>

				<p>
					It seems that a lot of web developers like to communicate their expertise via animated graphs. Whether or not this is an effective measure of anything has been subject to intense debate; however, I wanted to include the below graph to show that I have skills, and that they are graph-worthy. Tap or click the gray background to see my awesomeness in using these specially selected technologies.

				<h1>Some of my work</h1>

				<p>
					Right now, this website is the extent of my live web design and development work. I've designed another <a href=
					"http://web.archive.org/web/20130824153659/http://www.cse.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">website</a> that is no longer live, and that project has its own <a href="#">story</a>. Follow <a href="#">this link</a> to read my experience building this site. As I populate this site with more projects, you will be able to click on the project page to see the work, get an idea of my work-flow, see how I identified and overcame obstacles, and what I learned from each work piece.
