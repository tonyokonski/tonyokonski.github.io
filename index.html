      <h1>What I do</h1>

      <p>
      Currently, I work for a private school system as a computer and network support specialist, providing support for an Early Learning Center, an Elementary Campus, a Secondary Campus, two Churches, and a business office. I am the go-to guy when someone has a problem with anything technically related. In my spare time, I enjoy learning about network security, programming languages, and virtualization.  <strong>I am actively seeking new employment in order to further develop my skills in IT support, as well as to advance my career within this field.</strong> Feel free to visit my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonyokonski" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a> to see how I can be of help to your company.

      <h1>Why you should hire me</h1>

      <p>
      	I have a passion for helping people and I absolutely enjoy helping folks with their IT needs. I love being in the trenches and want to be a part of a team that helps people get stuff done. I routinely solve computer related issues in a fast paced environment and am able to prioritize on the fly so that the most important issues are resolved in a timely manner. I have a special interest in network troubleshooting and security, and am pursuing my Network+ certification. In the future, I see myself having climbed the career ladder at your company and playing a role in network administration and security.

      <h1>Obligatory animated skill set graph</h1>

      <p>
        It seems that many people like to communicate their expertise in a given area with an animated graph. Whether or not this is an effective measure of anything has been subject to intense debate; however, I wanted to include the <span id="stacked-directions">below graph</span><span id="adjacent-directions">graph to the right</span> in order to show that I have skills, and that they are indeed graph-worthy. Tap or click anywhere within the <span id="gray-helper">gray background</span> of the graph to see my awesomeness in using these specially selected technologies.
