					<h1>Some of my work</h1>

					<p>
						Right now, this website is the extent of my live web design and development work. I've designed another <a href=
						"http://web.archive.org/web/20130824153659/http://www.cse.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">website</a> that is no longer live, and that project has its own story which I will publish as soon as possible. I'll also link to a project page that describes my experience building this site. As I populate this site with more projects, you will be able to click on their respective project pages to get an idea of my work-flow, see how I identified and overcame obstacles, and what I learned from each project.

				<h1>About me; basically.</h1>

				<p>
					I became interested in web development about 4 years ago while I was working as a communications coordinator in a computer science department at a well-known university. My job enabled me to play with snippets of html, css, and JavaScript. I was amazed at what I could create with those tools. I was also surrounded by computer scientists and their students, and was able to learn about the basics of web development and programming. Now I want to take the next step and be a part of a team that builds fantastic websites. For a more detailed story of my journey, visit <a href="#">my in-depth bio page</a>.

					<h1>Obligatory animated skill set graph</h1>

					<p>
						It seems that a lot of web developers like to communicate their expertise via animated graphs. Whether or not this is an effective measure of anything has been subject to intense debate; however, I wanted to include the <span id="stacked-directions">below graph</span><span id="adjacent-directions">graph to the right</span> in order to show that I have skills, and that they are indeed graph-worthy. Tap or click anywhere in the <span id="gray-helper">gray background</span> to see my awesomeness in using these specially selected technologies.
