				<h1>Welcome!</h1>

				<p>
					Thanks for stopping by my little slice of the web. This portfolio site is a work in progress. Feel free to cruise around and learn more about my journey as a web developer. Although this journey is in its early stage, and there is not much here at the moment; check back often as this will be the platform for my many ideas for web projects. Cheers!

					I became interested in web development about 4 years ago. My job at the time enabled me to play with snippets of html and css, and I was amazed at what I could create with them. I was also surrounded by computer scientists and their students; many of whom have dedicated thier lives to creating useful tools for... I was able to learn from many of them about the DOM, about JS, etc... For a more detailed story of my journey, visit <a href="#">my in-depth bio page</a>.

				<h1>Obligatory animated skill set graph</h1>

				<p>
					It seems that a lot of web developers like to communicate their expertise via animated graphs. Whether or not this is an effective measure of anything has been subject to intense debate; however, I wanted to include the below graph to show that I have skills, and they are graph-worthy. Click or tap the gray background to see my awesomeness in using these selected technologies.
