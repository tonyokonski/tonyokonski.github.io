Hello! This is my online resume. As you can tell it is a work in progress, and I imagine that it always will be.

Design Philosophy: Mobile first with progressive enhancement. I want to create a simple baseline experience, and then design presentation and interactivity in a way that provides a richer experience for those who are using modern browsing technology.

Methodology: Free flow. A few sketches with no mock-ups or prototyping, and in my opinion, a bad design experience. I felt I am spending large amounts of time fixing many small issues without resolving major ones. Further details about this site's design and construction will be availible on a design description page in the near future. In future projects I will have a more structured approach to design and implementation.

Needs (as of 1/16/15):

1. Finish layout for larger viewports.

2. Upload portfolio examples with their design description pages.

3. Develop the user experience.

4. Continue to improve the site.

5. ?

I'm currently looking for an Entry Level Web Designer/Developer Position. Please feel free to contact me at tonyokonski@gmail.com with any questions regarding my experience or availibility.
